# RFM-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I implemented RFM analysis using clustering algorithms (K-means and DBSCAN) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Utilized Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
