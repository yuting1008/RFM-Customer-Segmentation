# RFM-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using clustering algorithms including K-means and DBSCAN to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. I utilized Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
